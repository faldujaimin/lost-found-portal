Software Requirements Specification (SRS) for Lost and Found Portal
1. Introduction
1.1. Purpose
The purpose of this Software Requirements Specification (SRS) document is to detail the functional and non-functional requirements for the Lost and Found Portal. This portal aims to provide a centralized, efficient, and secure platform for students to report lost or found items within an educational institution, and for designated administrators/HODs to manage these listings. This document serves as a guide for development, testing, and future enhancements of the system.

1.2. Scope
The Lost and Found Portal will allow students to:

Register and log in using their unique registration number and password.

Report lost items with details such as item name, description, date lost, and location lost.

Report found items with details such as item name, description, date found, location found, and an optional image upload.

View a list of all active lost and found items.

View detailed information for individual items.

The portal will allow Admin/HOD users to:

Log in with their designated credentials.

View all active and historical (soft-deleted) items.

Soft-delete (archive) items from the active list, moving them to a historical record.

The system will maintain a history of all items, including details of who reported them, when, and if/when/by whom they were soft-deleted.

1.5. Overview
This document is organized into three main sections: Introduction, Overall Description, and Specific Requirements. The Introduction provides the purpose, scope, and definitions. The Overall Description outlines the general factors affecting the product. The Specific Requirements section details the functional and non-functional requirements in a precise manner.

2. Overall Description
2.1. Product Perspective
The Lost and Found Portal is a standalone web application designed for a specific educational institution. It is not part of a larger system but will interact with standard web browsers. It replaces manual, informal, or paper-based lost and found processes.

2.2. Product Functions
The primary functions of the system include:

Secure user authentication (student, admin, HOD).

Reporting of lost items.

Reporting of found items with image uploads.

Displaying active lost and found items.

Providing detailed views of individual items.

Maintaining a comprehensive history of all reported items.

Allowing Admin/HOD roles to manage (soft-delete) items.

2.3. User Characteristics
Students: Primary users. Expected to be familiar with basic web navigation and form submission. Will use the portal to report and search for items.

Admin/HOD: Administrative users. Expected to have a higher level of technical familiarity. Will manage item listings, view history, and potentially manage user accounts (future scope).

2.4. Constraints
Technology Stack: Python (Flask), HTML, CSS, JavaScript. SQLAlchemy for ORM.

Database: SQLite for development; scalable relational database (e.g., PostgreSQL, MySQL) for production.

Security: Password hashing, protection against common web vulnerabilities (e.g., SQL injection, XSS).

Image Storage: Images will be stored on the server's file system within the application's static/uploads directory.

User Identification: Students will be uniquely identified by their registration number.

Deployment Environment: Standard web server environment (e.g., Gunicorn/uWSGI with Nginx/Apache for production).

2.5. Assumptions and Dependencies
Internet Connectivity: Users require internet access to use the web portal.

Browser Compatibility: The application will be compatible with modern web browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari).

Server Resources: Adequate server disk space for image storage and sufficient processing power for application operation.

User Data Accuracy: User-provided data (e.g., item descriptions, contact info) is assumed to be accurate.

Admin/HOD Availability: Designated Admin/HOD personnel will be available to manage the system.

Messages: Flash messages (success, error, info) will be displayed prominently to provide user feedback.

4.2. Hardware Interfaces
No specific hardware interfaces are required beyond a standard server to host the application and client devices (computers, smartphones, tablets) to access it.

4.3. Software Interfaces
Web Server Gateway Interface (WSGI): The Flask application will interface with a WSGI server (e.g., Gunicorn, uWSGI) in a production environment.

Database Interface: SQLAlchemy (ORM) will interface with the chosen database (SQLite for development, PostgreSQL/MySQL for production).

Operating System: The application will interact with the underlying operating system for file system operations (e.g., creating directories, saving uploaded files).

4.4. Communications Interfaces
HTTP/HTTPS: All communication between the client browser and the server will be over HTTP (development) and HTTPS (production) protocols.

Standard Ports: The application will typically run on port 5000 (development) or standard web ports 80/443 (production).
